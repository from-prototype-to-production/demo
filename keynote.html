        <p class="speaker-bio">
            AI Architect / Artificial Intelligence Co-chair Innovation Roundtable, Federal Reserve Bank of New York <br>
            Harry Mendell specializes in artificial intelligence and enterprise data architecture and is designing innovative solutions combining these disciplines for the Federal Reserve. He is in the Enterprise Architecture Group and is also co-chairman of the AI Innovation Roundtable which helps to promote the use of safe AI and machine learning throughout the system. Harry has a BS and MS in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania. His thesis was on artificial intelligence and computer vision. He then worked at Bell Labs with the original Unix team to design the first Unix-based workstation. He then joined the financial sector focusing first on the pricing and trading of equity and credit derivatives and later on risk management and compliance. The re-emergence of AI and NLP around 2012 led Harry back to his original interests in these areas and he formed a startup to research and develop semantic search and AI/ML applications in FinTech which included financial compliance tools. Realizing that the opportunity to detect risk and seeing the larger picture of transforming the way we process data and make decisions was too large and too important for a startup, he decided to take a more direct route introducing these ideas at the Federal Reserve.
