   <h2>Conference Overview </h2>
   The <a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> International Conference on AI in Finance (<a href="https://ai-finance.org/">ICAIF</a>) is a scholarly peer-reviewed conference that aims to bring together researchers from both academia and industry to share challenges, advances, and insights on the impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on finance. ICAIF is supported by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). We invite participation from academia, government, regulatory agencies, financial institutions, NGOs, and other stakeholders in the AI and Finance community. 
   <h2>Workshop Overview </h2>
Deploying machine learning models in production has challenges across multiple dimensions. Challenges spanning across scale (computation power, infrastructure support), software development, continuous integration-continues deployment CI/CD, and eventually the consumption of the model for desired use cases and their cascading effects. Over the past few years, this process has been captured under the specific umbrella of ML Ops and more recently LLM Ops. ML Ops is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous delivery practice of DevOps in the software field. The ecosystem of ML Ops is further convoluted for any industry with strict regulatory requirements and even more complex for the financial sector. Any significant event or sudden changes in the market can throw these ML models askew. While implementing these models in production they have to be robust against sudden changes in the market at the same time checks need to be put in place to identify any anomalies, outliers, drift, and bad data.

<h2>Location</h2>
   The workshop is co-located with the 5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF) in New York City. <br>
   
   <b>Hosted by</b>: The Finance and Risk Engineering Department, New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, at the Brooklyn NY campus.
